# Untitled Game Language

- To evolve games for maximum complexity according to a search-based player agent, run `python evolve.py`.
- To aggregate all unique environments that have been generated over the course of evolution, and record playtraces of their solutions as generated by search, run `python evolve.py aggregate_playtraces=True`
- To imitation learn on these "oracle" playtraces, run `python train_il_player.py`.
